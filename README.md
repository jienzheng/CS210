# CS210 - Data Structures

Programming projects that I have completed for Data Structures

## Description

Learning Data Structures and applying different data structures to complete these programming projects using C++.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* MacOS
* C++ (11)
* CLion or VSCode
* gcc compiler or g++ compiler


### Installing
* Download provided code
* Install required dependencies
* Make sure dependencies are installed properly by running:
  ```
  $ gcc --version
  $ g++ --version
  ```

### Executing program using IDEs

* Clion - run button that will automatically create Cmake files for the code to run.
* Running code on VSCode will require you to add additional code onto the JSON files.

### Executing program terminal/cmd

* Make sure that you are in the directory of where the program resides
  ```
  $ cd 'path/to/your/project'
  $ g++ -o <name-you-want-to-give> driver.cpp
